Dear company_name,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you on behalf of NIT-Delhi, to request your sponsorship for our upcoming college fest. We are excited to be hosting this event and expect to have a large turnout of students from various colleges across the region.

As a reputed company, we believe that your support would be immensely valuable in making our fest a success. Your sponsorship would not only help us to cover the expenses but also provide an opportunity for your brand to gain exposure among a diverse audience.

We have various sponsorship packages available, ranging from 10,000 to 1 Lac, and we would be happy to customize a package to meet your specific needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the possibility of working with you and appreciate your support.
